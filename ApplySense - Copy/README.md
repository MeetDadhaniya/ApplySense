# ApplySense 🎯
Stop applying blindly. Start applying smarter.

ApplySense is a small web app built to help students and entry-level job seekers track job applications and understand which strategies actually work during the job hunt.

Instead of guessing or applying everywhere, it helps users make decisions based on real application data.

## Why ApplySense 🤔

While applying for internships, I realized I had no clear way to track:
- where I was applying
- which platforms worked
- which roles I was getting responses for

ApplySense was built to solve this problem in a simple, practical way.

## Features ⚙️

- Track job and internship applications
- View response rates by application source
- See role-wise performance
- Get warnings for consistently underperforming sources
- Export application data as CSV
- Fully local-first (no login, no backend)

## Privacy 🔒

All data is stored using browser localStorage.
No accounts, no tracking, no servers.

## Tech Stack 🛠️

- HTML
- CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Browser localStorage

Frameworks were intentionally avoided to focus on frontend fundamentals.
